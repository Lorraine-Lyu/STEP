        <div class="proj">
          <p> I did my first extracurricular coding project in high school. 
              At that time my classmates and I formed a group to compete in 
              <a herf="https://launchx.com/" class="link" alt="LaunchX Homepage">LaunchX</a>, 
              a young entrepreneur program originated in MIT.
              The theme we got was "Education", 
              and when we were doing the market research, 
              we found that lots of Chinese students (including ourselves) 
              who want to have college educations abroadnhave great difficulcy 
              getting information about college application process. 
              Moreover, students know little about the colleges 
              they're gonna apply to and they don't know 
              where to get their resource.
              So we built a website, 
              <a href="https://collegefork.com/" class="link" alt="Link To CollegeFork">
                CollegeFork
              </a> (we randomly picked a name).
          </p>
          <p> On our website, we built a 
              <a href="https://collegefork.com/match/filter.html" class="link"
                  alt="Link To A Fliter With Personalized College Recommandation">
              filter</a> for our users to find their best choices. <br>
              We also made

          <p> Highlight: I made all the illustrations on the GUI!

          <p> During my first semester at Smith College, 
              I expanded a in-class project into CS major advisor webpage, 
              which gives suggestions on the next course a student should take.
              Most colleges already have similar services to student.

              Dr. Sahar Al Seesi</a> to analyze RNA data aiming to find a 
              vaccine for ovarian cancer I used Python to fliter RNA data 
              whose corresponding RNA takes part in transcription and the 
              portein they produce can potentially be found by the immune 
              system. In addition, I rewrote over 25% of the pipeline 
              and speeded up the entire process by approximately 4%.

          <p>I'm currently working on a website which host 
              personal webpage(similar to portfolio) for user. 
              The project uses React.js for frontend framework, 
              redux.js for global state(variable) management 
              and AWS dynamoDB database.
