        <div class="proj">
          <p>I had my first extracurricular coding project when I was in high school. 
            At that time my classmates and I formed a group in <a herf="https://launchx.com/">LaunchX</a>, a young entrepreneur program originated in MIT.
            The theme we got was "Education", and when we were doing the market research, we found that lots of Chinese students (including ourselves) who want to have college educations abroad
            had great difficulcy getting information about college application process. Moreover, students know little about the colleges they're gonna apply to and they don't know where to get their resource.
            So we built a website, <a href="https://collegefork.com/">CollegeFork</a> (we randomly picked a name).
          </p>
          <p> On our website, we built a <a href="https://collegefork.com/match/filter.html">filter</a> for our users to find their best choices. <br>
            We also made <a href="https://collegefork.com/dive/">short intro of each colleges</a>
          </p>
          <p>Highlight: I made all the illustrations on the GUI!

          <p> During my first semester at Smith College, I expanded a in-class project into CS major advisor webpage, which gives suggestions on the next course a student should take.
            Most colleges already have similar services to student.

          <p>During my second semester at Smith, I worked with <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/sahar-al-seesi"> Dr. Sahar Al Seesi</a> to analyze RNA data aiming to find a vaccine for ovarian cancer.
            I used Python to fliter RNA data whose corresponding RNA takes part in transcription and the portein they produce can potentially be found by the immune system.
            In addition, I rewrote over 25% of the pipeline and speeded up the entire process by approximately 4%.

          <p>I'm currently working on a website which host personal webpage(similar to portfolio) for user. The project uses React.js for frontend framework, redux.js for global state(variable) management and AWS dynamoDB database.
